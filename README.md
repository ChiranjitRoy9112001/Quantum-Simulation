 Quantum-Simulation is the name of the project.
"1D continuous time quantum walk" plot evolution of probability distribution of quantum walker in 1D in continuous time. The hamiltonian used is "Nearest Neighbor Hopping Hamiltonian".
"1D discrete time quantum walk" plot evolution of probability distribution of quantum walker in 1D in discrete time.
